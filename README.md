# <Coding Study Guide for Beginners>

## This guide will assist you in understanding the basic fundamentals of coding.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? My motivation of this project was to better understand web development through this lesson and the processes of developing a website.
- Why did you build this project? I built this website to better understand the processes of web development through Github and how to implement different areas of code to develop a website.
- What problem does it solve? It helps provide an understanding of how to create a website but also step by step instructions on how to do so.
- What did you learn? I learned about Javascript, HTML, and CSS and how these codes work together to make a website.


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation N/A

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage
To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.


Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

N/A

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
